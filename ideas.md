### Idea 1: Vintage Magic Theater

**Design Movement:** Art Deco meets Victorian Stage Magic

**Core Principles:**
- Rich, theatrical atmosphere with velvet textures and gold accents
- Dramatic lighting effects with spotlight-like highlights
- Ornate frames and decorative borders reminiscent of vintage magic posters
- Layered depth with curtain-like reveals

**Color Philosophy:** Deep burgundy (#722F37) and midnight black (#1A1A2E) as primary backgrounds, with antique gold (#D4AF37) accents and cream (#FFF8E7) for text. The palette evokes the grandeur of classic magic theaters.

**Layout Paradigm:** Card-based masonry grid with ornate gilded frames around each trick. Hero section features a stage-like presentation with curtain animations.

**Signature Elements:**
- Gilded corner ornaments on cards
- Subtle sparkle/shimmer animations on hover
- Playing card suit motifs as decorative elements

**Interaction Philosophy:** Reveal-based interactions - cards flip, curtains part, items appear from "nowhere"

**Animation:** Slow, elegant fades with occasional sparkle effects. Cards lift slightly on hover with subtle shadow deepening.

**Typography System:** Display: Playfair Display (elegant serif), Body: Crimson Text (readable serif)

### Idea 2: Japanese Minimalist Catalog

**Design Movement:** Muji-inspired Japanese Minimalism with Tenyo's Japanese heritage

**Core Principles:**
- Clean, uncluttered layouts with generous whitespace
- Subtle paper-like textures and soft shadows
- Asymmetric balance with intentional negative space
- Focus on product imagery as the hero element

**Color Philosophy:** Warm off-white (#FAF9F6) background with charcoal (#2D2D2D) text, accented by a single signature red (#C41E3A) inspired by Japanese design. The palette is restrained but warm.

**Layout Paradigm:** Asymmetric grid with varying card sizes based on popularity/rarity scores. Left-aligned navigation with floating filter panel.

**Signature Elements:**
- Subtle ink-wash style dividers
- Red seal/stamp motifs for ratings
- Thin, precise borders with rounded corners

**Interaction Philosophy:** Gentle, purposeful - elements respond with subtle scale changes and soft shadows

**Animation:** Minimal, refined micro-animations. Smooth scrolling with elements fading in gently. No flashy effects.

**Typography System:** Display: Noto Serif JP (elegant Japanese-inspired), Body: Inter (clean, modern)
