      "'I really like this effect. It's easy to do and for most people this is pretty baffling. There's a litle gimmicked thing envolved which makes the effect work, so clever ... . In this trick the use of ordinary black plastic also makes sense, other matreials could arouse suspicion. One of those Tenyo effects where you only need one, this will last a lifetime if you handle it as it should.' - David DeTenyo, Tenyo Magic Forum",
      "'This trick leaves a mixed impression because despite the fact that the props is well designed and well made, the effect really does not impress. To be clear this effect will be successful only in the hands of a skilled magician able to sublimate the trick through movement perfectly smooth and under control. It is imperative to present this trick with gentleness and simplicity so that every gesture seem as natural as possible to remove any doubt in the sequence of manipulations. Because if these handling are not well executed, the audience will immediately understand the trick that allows the playing card to escape. So here there is no particular mechanism and this may be what disappoint Tenyo fans. Despite all the best magician may find an interest with \"Escape King\" if they are able to master the effect and present it in a poetic way.' - tenyo-magic.blogspot.com",

The effect is really magical because the revelation appears like a hologram, and despite the very rapid movement of the tube, pictures appear very clearly and remain stable in the air. This fascinating optical trick is reminiscent of optical toys produced in the late 1800s. It does, however, take a real knack to get the tube to spin properly.
